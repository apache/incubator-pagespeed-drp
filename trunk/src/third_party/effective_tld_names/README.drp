Description:
effective_tld_names contains the public suffix list. From publicsuffix.org:

A "public suffix" is one under which Internet users can directly
register names. Some examples of public suffixes are ".com", ".co.uk"
and "pvt.k12.wy.us". The Public Suffix List is a list of all known
public suffixes.

The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is
maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any
software, but was originally creaated to meet the needs of browser
manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:

* Avoid privacy-damaging "supercookies" being set for high-level
  domain name suffixes
* Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user
  interface
* Accurately sort history entries by site

Local Modifications:
* The DOMAIN REGISTRY PROVIDER SYNTHESIZED DOMAINS section of
  effective_tld_names.dat was generated by scripts/synthesize_entries.py
  When you updatingeffective_tld_names.dat, synthesize_entries.py needs to be
  run to create that section.
